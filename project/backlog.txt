SpriteMaster

	make it work standalone

	be more agressive with sprite reduction during conversion
		there are a lot of duplicate sprites or sequences that I don't deduplicate

	add option to gg2c to slice sprite in 16 pixel high rows starting from y = 0

	show a BuildMaster log in a window
	
	detect that the game needs building on start up
		any file in 
			source 
			gamedata 
			assets
			that is newer than the rom

	choose to only build when clicking play button
	choose to not block SceneMaster when opening emulator
		next runs just build the rom
