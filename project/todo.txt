	DONE destroying an object should just set its update and draw functions to appropriate doNothing()

	NAH tilesets should contain their paletes
	


	DONE how to make it so that a broken block gets a custom animation?
		breakable tilesets have a function and a resource
		<tileset>_collisionFunction
		how to define the resource? 
			<tileset>_collisionResource?
				does it have to be an animation?
					it doesn't.
					it can be any type of resource


	NAH particle system
	
		array of 16 tracked particles
			screen x
			screen y
			update function
			speed x
			speed y

			animation
			update animation
			lifetime
			clipping			
		what's the diff between this and just having 32 effect objects?

	DONE collision map too much? use the map instead?
		use bigger bit flags?

	DONE destructable tiles
		collide with a 32x24 terrain buffer and not the map
		terrain buffer is u8 ?

	DONE animated tiles

			- tilesets are stored/loaded contigously

		upload animated tiles to vdp using UNSAFE_SMS_load4Tiles()
		
	DONE post animated tiles rework		
	
		test loading 4 tilesets
	
		how to tell the map that an animated tileset uses X number of tiles?

	NAH player is looping past 16k on the x coordinate
