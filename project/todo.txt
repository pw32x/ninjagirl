Todo

	NOPE have bank number as part of a resource

	NAH motion path for shotgun
		INSTEAD tweaked animation and spawn positions

	DONE basic motion path for delivery robot
	
	DONE add feature to SceneMaster to set an objects position on screen when spawning

	DONE make wheelers appear from the left side of the screen

	NAH sparks instead of falling debris?
		go with small explosions for now.

	make bullets move relative to the screen, not the world
		because when the player runs, the bullets (like the shotgun) don't appear to go 
		as far.
		
		or just add the player speed to the projectile
	

	
	enemies from up top to shoot at. monkeys? bomb lobbing monkeys?

	explosions as sequences

	performance pass...
	
		collisions are especially slow
		
		max number of active sprites?
			the spawner checks the limit?
				but only for enemies, not triggers, etc.
	
	object states
	
		spawn object in a certain state
		expose available states
		how to set states in SceneMaster?
		CreateInfoWithState ?
		Declare available states in template
		
	SceneMaster
	
		set data to an object, like a motion path

	Motion Master
		more complex motion path for delivery robot		
			flies in, waits, flies out


	Work with resourcesinfos and not resources so to better handle banking
	
	have a function that uses a resource switch to that bank before doing anything
	in the bank switch function, cache the bank and check it before doing the switch

	
	game/level handling
	
		lives
		
		lives pick up
		
		lives hud indicator
		
		lose life
		
		death pits
		
		respawn
			don't respawn on top of a hole
			
		spawn in animation
		
		enemy-player collisions	
	
		level has intro action
			opening doors

	Motion Master
	
		build motion paths by capturing mouse movement

	PAUSE animation sequencer
		explosion sequences
		AnimationSequencePack
			array of animation sequences
			
			animation sequence
				array of 
					time, function, value, control (go to next immediate, wait until next tick, jump, frame end)
					  u8,      u16,   u16,     u16
					functions
						set animation frame
						jump to sequence index
						trigger (die, effect, etc)
		
	PAUSE animation sequencer is another type of animation
		
	make explosion cooler
		multiple with particle effects
			explore 3x3 with four frames
	
	make bullets cooler
	
	make bullets have only one point as collision


	game level
	
		enemy AI


	fight for portal/trigger/something to go to next area


	

	tiled enemies use second palette?
		or backgrounds use their own palette?
		
	export Graphics Gale layers to separate files
		player
			gun_girl_bottom.gal
			gun_girl_top.gal
			gun_girl_ponytail.gal

		build a resource packs out of them

	draw player in parts

		legs
	
		torso

			move player torso when shooting?
				Contra: up and down
				Gunstar Heroes: only the arms move
	

		ponytail
			
			animate when jumping, running
	

		
	sprties
	
		slow tall enemy
		
		pod that opens and deploys enemy
			flying enemy
			running enemy
			
		wall

	game

		start work on a real level

	tools
	
		add a flag when exporting an animation to export the other side too	
			*_flipped
			
		for sprites that are loaded completely into vdp ram,
		have a setting that creates a flipped version

	what kind of game objects?
		visible game objects (enemies, pick ups, effects, etc)
		invisible triggers
		invisible objects like a music manager
		tile animator

	have object always switch to their animation's bank when calling update function?
		and the draw function?
		do both at the same time?

	Game
	
		rock particles don't appear in the correct position on screen when spawned
	
	Engine
	
		store animated tiles only in bank 0/1?

	space pass

		compress standard animations

		compress tileset
		
		decompress tileset
	
		find ways to save rom space with animations
		
			for streaming animations, only store the tile differences in an animation
			copy the tile differences only to 

	BuildMaster
	
		building .c files seems to eat warnings and some errors, causing a freeze
		
		compile using multiple parallel processes
	
	performance pass

		particles and projetiles are expensive

		improve buildcolumn performance
			do a bit every frame
			
			I already know how many tiles I have to update

		unroll loop to update terrain buffer


	Engine

		raster effects
	
		go to next level

	
	that thing where I swap in and out parts of the background
		the ground and the sky need to be separate tilesets
	
		ground/sky/animated
	
	compress map data
		where do I uncompress it? ram? is there room?
		
	store map data column first
	
	move sprites into the first half of tile vdp memory
		reduce the handling of resourceinfo index size from 16bit to 8 bit
	
	don't do everything at the same time during vblank
		- update player animation
		- update animated tiles
		- modify map tiles
		- animate tile-based objects
		- etc.
	
	
	clipping????
	
		regular animations
		
		batched animations
	
		gg2c, on export, sort sprites in a frame by X position
			then clip by x position
	
	
	automated creation of header file with object_type_ids
		header file with #defines of GAMEOBJECT_PLAYER_ID
		array of create functions in ROM
		"last checked" compares against time stamps of all cpp files with GAME_OBJECT_CREATE tag 
			if older than at least one of the animations, rebuild.
	
	automated creation of header file with VDPtileLocations (and animations?)
		array of VDPTileLocations in ram
		array of animations in rom
		header file with #defines PLAYER_ANIMATION_ID
		"last hecked"

	work in points

	place game objects on the map
	
	optimization pass
		object manager
			no loops
			no array
				just five objects
		scroll manager
			unroll rool to fill buffer
			or assembly?
				ask chat gpt

	add player standing state
	add player moving state
	
	player collisions
	physics
	
	clipping
	

	slopes?
	
	create assert 
		black screen?
		print message
			file/line


	try the SDCC Visual Studio project
		maybe debugging works well?
