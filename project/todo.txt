Todo

	Sprite Master C++

		NAH reuse identical frames
		reuse identical spans
	
		add slice style
			smallest area (default)
			grid
			rows
			columns

		In Graphics Gale
			No specifier:
			default: Normal
			
			applies to single frame:
			Slice:SmallestArea
			Slice:Columns
			Slice:Rows
			Slice:FixedGrid
				
			applies to all frames:
			DefaultSlice:SmallestArea
			DefaultSlice:Columns
			DefaultSlice:Rows
			DefaultSlice:FixedGrid




		plane animation seems to not work
			a 2 frame animation only exports 1 frame.


	
	make all projects use visual studio 2022
	
	object placement tool
		SceneMaster			

	have object switch to their animation's bank when calling update function?



	be more agressive with sprite reduction during conversion
		there are a lot of duplicate sprites or sequences that I don't deduplicate

	add option to gg2c to slice sprite in 16 pixel high rows starting from y = 0

	climbing walls?


	space pass

		compress tileset
		
		decompress tileset
	
		find ways to save rom space with animations
		
			for streaming animations, only store the tile differences in an animation
			copy the tile differences only to 


	
	performance pass

		particles and projetiles are expensive

		improve buildcolumn performance
			do a bit every frame
			
			I already know how many tiles I have to update

		unroll loop to update terrain buffer
vdp

	banks!

	object "templates"
	
	raster effects
	
	go to next level
	
	hybrid sprite/tile animations

	thingie that contains items
		lamp?
		balloon?
		enemy?
		
	game object templates
		animation
		health
		etc.
		
	hidden items
		trigger bounding box
		when hit enough
		call setVisbielTrue() on hidden item
		
	boss drops
		upgrade items 
		coins
		
		choose one

	hearts
	
	coins

	update all projects to Visual Studio 2022
	
		
	
	that thing where I swap in and out parts of the background
		the ground and the sky need to be separate tilesets
		
		build a map out of multiple tilesets
		
		ground/sky/animated

		
	make gg2c not suck
	make gal2tmx not suck	
		
	compress map data
		
	store map data column first
	
	don't do everything at the same time during vblank
		- update player animation
		- update animated tiles
		- modify map tiles
		- animate tile-based objects
		- etc.
	
	
	clipping????
	
		regular animations
		
		batched animations
	
		gg2c, on export, sort sprites in a frame by X position
			then clip by x position
	
	
	automated creation of header file with object_type_ids
		header file with #defines of GAMEOBJECT_PLAYER_ID
		array of create functions in ROM
		"last checked" compares against time stamps of all cpp files with GAME_OBJECT_CREATE tag 
			if older than at least one of the animations, rebuild.
	
	automated creation of header file with VDPtileLocations (and animations?)
		array of VDPTileLocations in ram
		array of animations in rom
		header file with #defines PLAYER_ANIMATION_ID
		"last hecked"

	work in points

	place game objects on the map
	
	optimization pass
		object manager
			no loops
			no array
				just five objects
		scroll manager
			unroll rool to fill buffer
			or assembly?
				ask chat gpt

	add player standing state
	add player moving state
	
	player collisions
	physics
	
	clipping
	

	slopes?
	
	create assert 
		black screen?
		print message
			file/line


Idea Backlog 

	Build Master 
	
		if the config file is newer
		how to update assets if the bank changed?
		how to tell what files the exporter created?\
			look at the destination folder. listen for new files.



	update ideas
	
		double jump
		slide (with invincibility frames)
		shoot up
		shoot eight directions
		option/familiar
		stronger projectiles
		health upgrade
		extra kunai (start with two, get a third one)
		hold to float down
		wall running. ubisoft prince of persia style, or run up walls Mario World style.

	spawn info has id of object type instead of pointer to create function
		automatic generation of gameobject_id.h from scanning header files

	BMS backup action? 
		
			copy backup locations	



	try the SDCC Visual Studio project
		maybe debugging works well?

	add player jumping state
	
	update player tiles

	if press attack button near enough to an enemy, do a slash attack
		
	
	add player shooting state
		
	player projectiles
	player shooting animation
		contra run + shoot style?
		
	fire up/diagonal/down
		round projectiles means fewer tiles taken, but not as cool
		as shuriken		
	
	queue of vdp tile updates
		
	better jump frame?
	better run animation?
	
	enemy
	enemy collisions	
	game object library
	
	object manager
		player + projectiles + enemies + interactables
		
		small arrays to handle different types. no generic system.
		
	how to use banked roms?
		
	animated tiles
	
	automated on-demand/on-dirty conversion of gamedata to c on build 
		
	automatic building of level build function per map
		loads all background and sprite tiles
		places player
	
	
	improve map scrolling performance

	music
	sound effects

	
Game Design Ideas	
	
	enemy types
		popcorn
		flying
		running
		bouncing
		peek-a-boo
		coming out of holes
		throwing/shooting from afar
		
	upgrades
		double jump
		slide
		familiar (doubles shooting shurikens)
	
	boss
	
effects

	rain
