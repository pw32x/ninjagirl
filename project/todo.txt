Todo

	new player sprite
	
		DONE fix boots when ducking
		
		DONE remove attack animations
		
		DONE shoot 8x16 bullets
		
		DONE don't jump up so fast
		
		DONE variable jump height
		
		DONE bullet needs to be more visible/contrasty
		
		DONE change ninjagirl template to gungirl template

		NAH I need a purple
		
		DONE fix spawner		
		
		DONE fix entities not getting destroyed when off screen
		
		SceneMaster

			DONE handle crash when the level doesn't exist anymore
			
			add toolbar with open/save/import buttons
			
			fix the build button
		
		remove binaries and raw files
		
		jump doesn't always work after hitting the ground
		
		when spawning an object, only spawn it when it is almost entirely visible
		
			spawn point is  X
			spawn position is X - (width of sprite - 8 pixels because of left column)
			width is visible area of sprite, not entire frame
		
		
		in-game color tweaker
		
		portal to go to next area
		
		fight to open the portal
			
		export Graphics Gale layers to separate files
			player
				gun_girl_bottom.gal
				gun_girl_top.gal
				gun_girl_ponytail.gal
	
			build a resource packs out of them

		draw player in parts

			legs
		
			torso

				move player torso when shooting?
					Contra: up and down
					Gunstar Heroes: only the arms move
		
	
			ponytail
				
				animate when jumping, running
		
	fix scenemaster game build button
		
	sprties
	
		slow tall enemy
		
		pod that opens and deploys enemy
			flying enemy
			running enemy
			
		wall

	game

		fix player running when placed on ground in SceneMaster

		start work on a real level

	tools
	
		add a flag when exporting an animation to export the other side too	
			*_flipped
			
		for sprites that are loaded completely into vdp ram,
		have a setting that creates a flipped version

	what kind of game objects?
		visible game objects (enemies, pick ups, effects, etc)
		invisible triggers
		invisible objects like a music manager
		tile animator

	have object always switch to their animation's bank when calling update function?
		and the draw function?
		do both at the same time?

	Game
	
		rock particles don't appear in the correct position on screen when spawned
	
	Engine
	
		store animated tiles only in bank 0/1?

	space pass

		compress standard animations

		compress tileset
		
		decompress tileset
	
		find ways to save rom space with animations
		
			for streaming animations, only store the tile differences in an animation
			copy the tile differences only to 

	BuildMaster
	
		building .c files seems to eat warnings and some errors, causing a freeze
		
		compile using multiple parallel processes
	
	performance pass

		particles and projetiles are expensive

		improve buildcolumn performance
			do a bit every frame
			
			I already know how many tiles I have to update

		unroll loop to update terrain buffer


	Engine

		raster effects
	
		go to next level

	
	that thing where I swap in and out parts of the background
		the ground and the sky need to be separate tilesets
	
		ground/sky/animated
	
	compress map data
		where do I uncompress it? ram? is there room?
		
	store map data column first
	
	move sprites into the first half of tile vdp memory
		reduce the handling of resourceinfo index size from 16bit to 8 bit
	
	don't do everything at the same time during vblank
		- update player animation
		- update animated tiles
		- modify map tiles
		- animate tile-based objects
		- etc.
	
	
	clipping????
	
		regular animations
		
		batched animations
	
		gg2c, on export, sort sprites in a frame by X position
			then clip by x position
	
	
	automated creation of header file with object_type_ids
		header file with #defines of GAMEOBJECT_PLAYER_ID
		array of create functions in ROM
		"last checked" compares against time stamps of all cpp files with GAME_OBJECT_CREATE tag 
			if older than at least one of the animations, rebuild.
	
	automated creation of header file with VDPtileLocations (and animations?)
		array of VDPTileLocations in ram
		array of animations in rom
		header file with #defines PLAYER_ANIMATION_ID
		"last hecked"

	work in points

	place game objects on the map
	
	optimization pass
		object manager
			no loops
			no array
				just five objects
		scroll manager
			unroll rool to fill buffer
			or assembly?
				ask chat gpt

	add player standing state
	add player moving state
	
	player collisions
	physics
	
	clipping
	

	slopes?
	
	create assert 
		black screen?
		print message
			file/line


	try the SDCC Visual Studio project
		maybe debugging works well?
