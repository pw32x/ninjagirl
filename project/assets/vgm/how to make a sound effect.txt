how to make a sound effect

	create a new song in Deflemask
	
	use SN3 or SN4 channels or both
	
	add an OFF note (using the Tab key) at the end of the effect
	
	reduce the rows with the - and + buttons to only have the notes that you play
	
	save the file
	
	save as vgm
	
	when saving the vgm, add it to the folder that matches the channels the effect plays on
		
		if effect plays on:
		
			SN3 -> channel2
			SN4 -> channel3
			both SN3 and SN4 -> channel23
			
			
		Deflemask channels are 1,2,3,4 while PSGLib and its tools use 0,1,2,3
